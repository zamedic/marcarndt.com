                    Initially, my career ambition was to be a doctor in an emergency room. Rather than investing years
                    at university for a unknown career, I decided to be a EMT first, to get an insight into the medical
                    career. I spent a few years on the roads of the Eastern Cape working for both the provincial
                    services as well as private. I quickly realised that medicine is highly specialised, doctors focus
                    on a small speciality, I made the personal realisation that I could not be suited for a profession
                    that wouldnt allow me diversity in my day to day role.<br/>
                    <br/>

                    I started by BSC in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics and Physics, working as a EMT after hours
                    and on weekends to provide an income to complete my university studies.

                    In my final year of university, I applied for the Standard Bank Graduate Development program and was
                    accepted. I moved up to johannesburg to start my new career. Initially, I was placed with the
                    internet banking team where I learned the ropes of what it means to be a true java developer. Appart
                    from adding new features to Internet Banking, I also worked on the new mobile banking platform, the
                    sms transaction system and a new java esb solution.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The bank embarked on a new SAP program, I was added to the team and without formal training, using
                    only the manuals, I was able to teach myself SAP ABAP and BSP development, developing a number of
                    SAP solutions.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    After the SAP implementation, I moved back to the Internet Banking team, this time as a more senior
                    member. We rewrote the front end to give it a new modern look and feel. <br/>
                    <br/>
                    We build the first customer front end for the Insurance team using C# .NET to provide insight for
                    bank architecture into the viability of .NET as the standard for software development. <br/>
                    <br/>
                    I lead a team that build a new messaging engine for the bank. The engine would provide services that
                    will allow anyone to be able to send email and sms messages to recipients based upon templates
                    defined by each business area using a JSF front end. The system was able to process around 2000
                    messages per second, which included One time passwords and transaction notifications.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    When the team moved to Sandton, the daily commute became a bit much, so I moved to a production
                    support team to work closer to home. Here I added automated monitoring to provide real time insight
                    into the production systems to alert us of issues before anyone else was aware. I also optimised
                    applications, reducing CPU usage at month end by around 20% and improving overall response time.
