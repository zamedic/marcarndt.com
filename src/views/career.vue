                    Initially, my career ambition was to be a doctor in an emergency room. Rather than investing years
                    at university for a unknown career, I decided to be a EMT first, to get an insight into the medical
                    career. I spent a few years on the roads of the Eastern Cape working for both the provincial
                    services as well as private. I quickly realised that medicine is highly specialised, doctors focus
                    on a small speciality, I made the personal realisation that I could not be suited for a profession
                    that wouldnt allow me diversity in my day to day role.<br/>
                    <br/>

                    I started by BSC in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics and Physics, working as a EMT after hours
                    and on weekends to provide an income to complete my university studies.

                <v-card-text>
                    In my final year of university, I applied for the Standard Bank Graduate Development program and was
                    accepted. I moved up to johannesburg to start my new career. Initially, I was placed with the
                    internet banking team where I learned the ropes of what it means to be a true java developer. Appart
                    from adding new features to Internet Banking, I also worked on the new mobile banking platform, the
                    sms transaction system and a new java esb solution.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The bank embarked on a new SAP program, I was added to the team and without formal training, using
                    only the manuals, I was able to teach myself SAP ABAP and BSP development, developing a number of
                    SAP solutions.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    After the SAP implementation, I moved back to the Internet Banking team, this time as a more senior
                    member. We rewrote the front end to give it a new modern look and feel. <br/>
                    <br/>
                    We build the first customer front end for the Insurance team using C# .NET to provide insight for
                    bank architecture into the viability of .NET as the standard for software development. <br/>
                    <br/>
                    I lead a team that build a new messaging engine for the bank. The engine would provide services that
                    will allow anyone to be able to send email and sms messages to recipients based upon templates
                    defined by each business area using a JSF front end. The system was able to process around 2000
                    messages per second, which included One time passwords and transaction notifications.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    When the team moved to Sandton, the daily commute became a bit much, so I moved to a production
                    support team to work closer to home. Here I added automated monitoring to provide real time insight
                    into the production systems to alert us of issues before anyone else was aware. I also optimised
                    applications, reducing CPU usage at month end by around 20% and improving overall response time.

                    I went through a divorce, and sadly my then ex wife also worked at Standard Bank, so I decided to
                    find an opportunity outside of Standard Bank. I joined African Bank as a Senior Java developer,
                    taking over development on their custom in house web application used by their branch staff to
                    service their customers. I also spear headed a new system for car dealers to offer loans to client
                    when purchasing a vehicle.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    I was not happy with the business practices of the organization, I did not feel like the work I was
                    doing was in the best interest of the customers, so I decided to leave the organization.
                    Approximately a year later the company was bankrupt due to their lending practices.

                <v-card-text>
                    I joined First National Bank as a senior Java developer on their CIB team. My first project was to
                    integrate the smart cash boxes into the banks accounting systems. As soon as a company deposited
                    money into their cash box, it would automatically reconcile with their bank account. The challenge
                    was rather interesting since the cash boxes used a proprietary TCP communication stream, so I was
                    able to build annotated POJO objects to automatically transform the data to and from the required
                    formats.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    While a Java developer, we started using the <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_software_process">Personal Software Process</a> and
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_software_process">Team Software Process</a>
                    methodologies.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    I then moved to another team implementing Tibco Business Works for the share brokerage and custodial
                    services department. Again, with no formal training and only google to help me, I picked up the
                    technology fairly rapidly. At this point, the agile methodologies, specifically the <a

                <v-card-text>
                    Upon my return to Standard Bank, I was asked to join the Internet Banking team. The team had fallen
                    into disarray with no IT best practices being used. Code was all over the place, in their own
                    branches, code was being lost, production builds were happening from developers laptops, the code
                    that was deployed to production was not the same as the code tested, ect... <br/>
                    <br/>
                    I mentored and lead the team to bring them inline with best practices. Code would be committed into
                    a branch, from there a code review was done, once accepted the code would be automatically merged to
                    master, tagged and a nexus release created. Only official released would go into test and the same
                    release from test would go live. <br/>
                    <br/>
                    I then lead a team to rebuild the Insurance System, using a Java Restful service layer with a
                    angular front end. In around 11 months, we completely redeveloped the entire insurance system,
                    including online quoting and policy management for a complete range of insurance products, including
                    various combinations of motor, household, funeral, personal, professional, ect.. cover.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    The new insurance system infrastructure was also built completely from code. Machines were KVM's and
                    chef was used to bootstrap and deploy the application, including app servers, web server and HA
                    Proxies. The complete life cycle from the developers machine to production was completely automated.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    The next challenge was the automation of the My Updates system, which send the notifications for
                    transactions to customers. The system ran on Z-Linux which was a challenge, since the chef cookbooks
                    are generally not compatible with Z-Linux. A number of open source cookbooks had to be updated to
                    work on the Z-Linux system. The next challenge was to get the chef client to work with Z-Linux, this
                    was a collaboration between myself and the Chef developers. Once the system went live, we were the
                    first in the work to use Chef for Z-Linux in production. <br/>
                    <br/>
                    From there, my focus shifted to assisting teams with their automation journeys. I started
                    development on bots in the mannerism of HAL from 2001, a space odyssey. HAL, is a open source
                    project written in Go, and running primarily on docker instances using kubernetes, openshift and aws
                    fargate. The primary focus on HAL to let teams know whats happening in their systems, and alert them
                    promptly when an anomaly is detected. To achieve the anomaly detection some custom machine learning
                    algorithms were developed that suit the volatile nature of batch processing vs online day
                    transactions. All messages sent from Hal, primarily to telegram, are scrutinised for language and
                    sentiment, preventing sensitive or inappropriate messages from being sent from hal. More of the
                    development is starting to happen using serverless constructs, such as aws lambda.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    Everything is build using code, primarily using Terraform to ensure that infrastructure is build
                    from code.
